## What's great about Codestral?

Unlike most existing coding LLMs, Codestral stands out with its **shared instruction and completion API endpoint**. This dual capability allows the same model to perform excellently in both code completion and chat tasks, greatly simplifying the developer AI stack and highlighting an important research direction we're extremly excited about. 

Besides, Codestral is trained on a diverse dataset of **80+ programming languages**, ensuring a high-quality experience for developers working with a wide range of languages.


## Get started with Codestral in Tabby
