# Highlights of Tabby v0.1.0: Apple M1/M2 Support
We are thrilled to announce the release of Tabby v0.1.0.

Thanks to [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), Apple M1/M2 Tabby users can now harness Metal inference support on Apple's M1 and M2 chips by using the `--device metal` flag.

This enhancement results in significant improvements in inference speed, marking a significant milestone in Tabby's adoption on Apple devices. Check out our [Model Directory](/docs/models) to discover models that come with Metal support!
