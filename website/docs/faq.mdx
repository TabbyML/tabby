  <summary>How much VRAM a LLM model consumes?</summary>
    <div>
        <p>By default, Tabby operates in int8 mode with CUDA, requiring approximately 8GB of VRAM for CodeLlama-7B.</p>
        <p>For ROCm the actual limits are currently largely untested, but the same CodeLlama-7B seems to use 8GB of VRAM as well on a AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX according to the ROCm monitoring tools.</p>

  <summary>What GPUs are required for reduced-precision inference (e.g int8)?</summary>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>int8: Compute Capability >= 7.0 or Compute Capability 6.1</li>
      <li>float16: Compute Capability >= 7.0</li>
      <li>bfloat16: Compute Capability >= 8.0</li>
    </ul>

  <summary>How to utilize multiple NVIDIA GPUs?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Tabby only supports the use of a single GPU. To utilize multiple GPUs, you can initiate multiple Tabby instances and set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES (for cuda) or HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES (for rocm) accordingly.</p>

  <summary>My AMD ROCm device isn't supported by ROCm</summary>
  <div>
    <p>
      You can use the HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION variable if there is a similar GPU that is supported by ROCm you can set it to that.
      For example for RDNA2 you can set it to 10.3.0 and to 11.0.0 for RDNA3.

  <summary>How can I convert my own model for use with Tabby?</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Since version 0.5.0, Tabby's inference now operates entirely on llama.cpp, allowing the use of any GGUF-compatible model format with Tabby. To enhance accessibility, we have curated models that we benchmarked, available at <a href="https://github.com/TabbyML/registry-tabby">registry-tabby</a>.</p>
    <p>Users are free to fork the repository to create their own registry. If a user's registry is located at <code>https://github.com/USERNAME/registry-tabby</code>, the model ID will be <code>USERNAME/model</code>.</p>
    <p>For details on the registry format, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/TabbyML/registry-tabby/blob/main/models.json">models.json</a></p>
