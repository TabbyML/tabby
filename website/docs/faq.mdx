# ⁉️ Frequently Asked Questions

<Collapse title="How much VRAM a LLM model consumes?">

By default, Tabby operates in int8 mode with CUDA, requiring approximately 8GB of VRAM for CodeLlama-7B.

For ROCm the actual limits are currently largely untested, but the same CodeLlama-7B seems to use 8GB of VRAM as well on a AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX according to the ROCm monitoring tools.

<Collapse title="What GPUs are required for reduced-precision inference (e.g int8)?">

* int8: Compute Capability >= 7.0 or Compute Capability 6.1
* float16: Compute Capability >= 7.0
* bfloat16: Compute Capability >= 8.0

To determine the mapping between the GPU card type and its compute capability, please visit [this page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

<Collapse title="How to utilize multiple NVIDIA GPUs?">

Tabby only supports the use of a single GPU. To utilize multiple GPUs, you can initiate multiple Tabby instances and set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES (for cuda) or HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES (for rocm) accordingly.

<Collapse title="My AMD device isn't supported by ROCm">

You can use the HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION variable if there is a similar GPU that is supported by ROCm you can set it to that.

For example for RDNA2 you can set it to 10.3.0 and to 11.0.0 for RDNA3.

<Collapse title="How can I use my own model with Tabby?">

Please follow the [Tabby Model Specification](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/blob/main/MODEL_SPEC.md) to create a directory with the specified files. You can then pass the directory path to `--model` or `--chat-model` to start Tabby.

<Collapse title="Can I use local model with Tabby?">

Tabby also supports loading models from a local directory that follow our specifications as outlined in [MODEL_SPEC.md](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/blob/main/MODEL_SPEC.md).

<Collapse title="Is it safe to put Tabby root directory on NFS filesystem?">

**No, it is not recommended to put Tabby's root directory on an NFS filesystem.**

Tabby depends on SQLite for its database operations, and SQLite requires proper file locking mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
Many networked filesystems, especially NFS, have broken or missing lock implementations that can lead to database corruption and unexpected behaviors.

For more technical details about this limitation, please refer to the SQLite documentation:
[Filesystems with broken or missing lock implementations](https://sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html#_filesystems_with_broken_or_missing_lock_implementations).
