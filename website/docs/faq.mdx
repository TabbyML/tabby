# ⁉️ Frequently Asked Questions

<Collapse title="How much VRAM a LLM model consumes?">

By default, Tabby operates in int8 mode with CUDA, requiring approximately 8GB of VRAM for CodeLlama-7B.

For ROCm the actual limits are currently largely untested, but the same CodeLlama-7B seems to use 8GB of VRAM as well on a AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX according to the ROCm monitoring tools.

<Collapse title="What GPUs are required for reduced-precision inference (e.g int8)?">

* int8: Compute Capability >= 7.0 or Compute Capability 6.1
* float16: Compute Capability >= 7.0
* bfloat16: Compute Capability >= 8.0

To determine the mapping between the GPU card type and its compute capability, please visit [this page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

This also seems to be available on AMD Radeon™ GPUs, but it's unclear which cards besides RDNA3 support this.

<Collapse title="How to utilize multiple NVIDIA GPUs?">

Tabby only supports the use of a single GPU. To utilize multiple GPUs, you can initiate multiple Tabby instances and set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES (for cuda) or HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES (for rocm) accordingly.

<Collapse title="My AMD device isn't supported by ROCm">

You can use the HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION variable if there is a similar GPU that is supported by ROCm you can set it to that.

For example for RDNA2 you can set it to 10.3.0 and to 11.0.0 for RDNA3.

<Collapse title="How can I convert my own model for use with Tabby?">

Since version 0.5.0, Tabby's inference now operates entirely on llama.cpp, allowing the use of any GGUF-compatible model format with Tabby. To enhance accessibility, we have curated models that we benchmarked, available at [registry-tabby](https://github.com/TabbyML/registry-tabby)

Users are free to fork the repository to create their own registry. If a user's registry is located at `https://github.com/USERNAME/registry-tabby`, the model ID will be `USERNAME/model`.

For details on the registry format, please refer to [models.json](https://github.com/TabbyML/registry-tabby/blob/main/models.json)
