# Roadmap

## Q4 2023
* 🔧 Improve RAG by deeper integration with Treesitter using custom query. This will bring LSP-lik understanding to tabby's code index.
* 🎁 M1/M2 GPU support by utilizing llama.cpp/ggml's inference support. This will make Tabby much faster on Apple devices.
* 📘 Improve the documentation and tutorials for Tabby. This will make it easier for people to learn how to use Tabby.
* 💡 Explore more creative ways of interacting with Tabby. Tabby currently only supports generating text in code completion scenarios, but we plan to add support for other use cases, such as interactive chat in diff mode and Q&A with multiple virtual engineers.
