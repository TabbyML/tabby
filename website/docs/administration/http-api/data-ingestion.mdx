# Data Ingestion

## Overview

Tabby provides an HTTP REST API that enables direct data ingestion into Tabby's index.

This API allows you to seamlessly integrate your own data sources,
ensuring that Tabby's code completion and chat experiences are tailored to your specific requirements and context.

## Data Ingestion HTTP API

The Data Ingestion API enables you to:

- Add custom documents to Tabby's index with a configurable time-to-live (TTL)
- Delete specific documents or all documents from a particular source

Note that all ingestion and deletion operations are processed asynchronously during scheduled index updates.

### Authentication

To use the Data Ingestion API, you must authenticate your requests.
Tabby's HTTP API uses Bearer API tokens for authentication.
Include your API key in the `Authorization` request header as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

API keys can be obtained from the Tabby web UI.


### Add Document

```http
POST /v1beta1/ingestion
```

Request Body:

```json
{
  "source": "custom-documentation",
  "id": "doc-id",
  "title": "API Documentation",
  "body": "This is the content of the documentation...",
  "link": "https://example.com/docs/123",
  "ttl": "90d"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `source` | string | **Required**. Source identifier for the document. Used for grouping and deletion operations. |
| `id` | string | **Required**. Unique identifier for the document within the same source. |
| `title` | string | **Required**. Title of the document. |
| `body` | string | **Required**. Content of the document to be indexed. |
| `link` | string | *Optional*. URL or reference to the original document. |
| `ttl` | string | *Optional*. Time-to-live duration (e.g., "90d" for 90 days). After this period, the document will be automatically removed during garbage collection. |

Response:

- 202 Accepted: The request has been accepted and will be processed later.
  ```json
  {
    "id": "doc123",
    "status": "pending",
    "message": "Your request has been accepted and will be processed later."
  }
  ```
- 400 Bad Request: The request was invalid.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Invalid request body",
    "message": "The request body is missing required fields or has invalid values."
  }
  ```
- 500 Internal Error: The server encountered an error while processing the request.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "message": "An unexpected error occurred while processing your request."

### Delete Document

```http
DELETE /v1beta1/ingestion/{source}
DELETE /v1beta1/ingestion/{source}/{id}
```

Deletes either all documents from a specific source (by `source`) or a specific document (by `source` and `id`).

Response:

- 202 Accepted: The request has been accepted and will be processed later.
  ```json
  {
    "id": "doc123",
    "status": "pending",
    "message": "The document deletion request has been accepted and will be processed."
  }
  ```
- 404 Not Found: The specified document or source does not exist.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Not Found",
    "message": "The specified document or source does not exist."
  }
  ```

    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "message": "An unexpected error occurred while processing your request."
  }
  ```

## Monitoring Ingestion Status

Since the ingestion process is asynchronous, you can monitor the status of your ingestion requests through the Tabby web UI,
under the `System` tab in the `Information` section.
