# Data Backup

:::info
We recommend regularly backing up the database to ensure data recovery in case of a failure. It's particularly advisable to back up before making significant changes such as upgrades or configuration modifications.
:::

By default, Tabby stores all its data in the `$HOME/.tabby` directory. However, you can override this behavior by using the `TABBY_ROOT` environment variable. This directory contains all the necessary data for Tabby's operation, including the database, logs, and configuration files.

## Database Backup

Tabby uses SQLite for data storage, with the default database located at `$HOME/.tabby/ee/db.sqlite`.
To conduct backup operations, you'll require the SQLite CLI.

1. Access the Tabby database using the SQLite CLI:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 $HOME/.tabby/ee/db.sqlite
   ```
2. Once inside the SQLite CLI, execute the `.backup` command to generate a backup of the database:
   ```bash
   .backup backup_database.db
   ```

Subsequently, a backup database named `backup_database.db` will be located in your current working directory.

For additional information, please consult the [SQLite Backup API](https://www.sqlite.org/backup.html).

## Event Logs Backup

Tabby stores all event logs in the `~/.tabby/events` directory. These events, stored in JSON format, are named after the date of their creation.

```
% ls ~/.tabby/events
