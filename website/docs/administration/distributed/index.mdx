# Multi-node and Load Balancing

:::subscription
This feature is available in the **Team** and **Enterprise** Plans.

Tabby provides built-in distributed support for multi-node setups. This allows you to scale your Tabby deployment horizontally and distribute the workload across multiple GPU workers.

## Start Tabby

Start the web UI using the following command:

```bash
tabby serve
```

By doing so, the web server will operate without a model attached to it. If you send a POST request to `/v1/completions`, you will receive a `501 Not Implemented` error.

## Check the Cluster Information

In the `Cluster Information` tab of the admin panel, you can see that there are no workers connected to the Tabby instance, except for the local code index.

You'll also notice the `Registration Token` displayed on this page. This token is used to authenticate the worker nodes with the Tabby instance and will be referred to as `TABBY_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` in the following sections.

## Register a Completion Worker

To register a worker, you need to run the following command:

```bash
# In this tutorial, we'll start the worker on the same machine as the web server.
export TABBY_WEBSERVER_URL=127.0.0.1:8080
export TABBY_REGISTRATION_TOKEN=<token from the admin panel>

tabby worker::completion \
  --model StarCoder-1B \
  --url $TABBY_WEBSERVER_URL \
  --token $TABBY_REGISTRATION_TOKEN \
  --port 8081
```

After this command executes successfully, you should see the new worker in the `Cluster Information` tab.
More workers can be added by running the same command on different machines to improve the concurrency of the system.
Tabby will distribute the workload across all the workers.

## (Optional) Register a Chat Worker

Similarly, you can register a chat worker by running the following command to enable the chat playground.

```bash
tabby worker::chat \
  --model Mistral-7B \
  --url $TABBY_WEBSERVER_URL \
  --token $TABBY_REGISTRATION_TOKEN \
  --port 8082
```

Once it's registered, you should see the `Chat Playground` entry under the avatar menu.
