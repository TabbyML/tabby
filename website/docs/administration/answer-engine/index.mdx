# Answer Engine

Tabby provides an `Answer Engine` on the homepage,
which can utilize the chat-model LLM and related context to answer user questions.

## Contexts

The `Answer Engine` can query the following contexts to provide more accurate answers.
For more information about contexts, please refer to the [Context Provider](../context/index.mdx).

### Source Code Repositories
The source code context is used to connect Tabby with a source code repository from Git, GitHub, GitLab, etc. Tabby fetches the data from the repository, and stores it in the index.

When users select a repository and ask a question, the Answer Engine retrieves relevant code and documents from the index to provide contextually accurate responses.

### Developer Documentation
When developer documentation contexts are set, users can simply type `@` to select documents they wish to include. Alternatively, users can click the icons below the chat box to select contexts directly. Tabby will then include these documents when interacting with LLMs.

## Thread


All threads created by a user appear in their `My Activities` tab. By default, new threads are temporary and automatically deleted after a week. The thread becomes persisted only when the creator clicks the `Share Link button.`, and it'll become visible to all team members under `Recent Activities` tab.

### Thread Permissions
- Write access: Creator only (edit / delete / ask follow-ups)
- Read access
  - Ephemeral threads:  Creator & server admins
  - Persistent threads: All team members

## Web Search

:::info
The `Web Search` is currently on Beta.
:::

Please note that the `web search` is a special context that can only be enabled by providing an environment variable `SERPER_API_KEY`. Once enabled, the Answer Engine can search the web for more relevant answers by using `@Web`.
