# Answer Engine

Tabby provides an `Answer Engine` on the homepage,
which can utilize the chat-model LLM and related context to answer user questions.

## Contexts

The `Answer Engine` can query the following contexts to provide more accurate answers.
For more information about contexts, please refer to the [Context Provider](../context/index.mdx):

1. Source code repositories
2. Developer documentation
3. Web search

### Source Code Repositories
The source code context is used to connect Tabby with a source code repository from Git, GitHub, GitLab, etc. Tabby fetches the data from the repository, and stores it in the index. The indexed data includes:
- Codebase
- Pull requests / Merge requests
- Issues
- Commits

### Developer Documentation
When developer documentation contexts are set, users can simply type `@` to select documents they wish to include. Alternatively, users can click the icons below the chat box to select contexts directly. Tabby will then include these documents when interacting with LLMs.

## Switching Chat Models
Once a third-party chat model provider is configured, users can select and switch between its available models for chat interactions.

## Custom System Prompt

Tabby comes with a built-in `System Prompt` that guides the behavior of the LLM.
You can customize the `System Prompt` to better meet your needs.

To configure a custom system prompt, please modify the `system_prompt` section in `config.yaml`.

Below is an example of a custom system prompt:

```toml title="~/.tabby/config.toml"
[answer]
system_prompt = """
Your are "Tabby", \
a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence designed for helping software developers. \
You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia"""
```

Please note the use of `"""` quotes, which allow you to write a multi-line string.


## Web Search

:::info
The `Web Search` is currently on Beta.
:::

Please note that the `web search` is a special context that can only be enabled by providing an environment variable `SERPER_API_KEY`. Once enabled, the Answer Engine can search the web for more relevant answers by using `@Web`.
