# Answer Engine

Tabby provides an `Answer Engine` on the homepage,
which can utilize the chat-model LLM and related context to answer user questions.

## Contexts

The `Answer Engine` can query the following contexts to provide more accurate answers.
For more information about contexts, please refer to the [Context Provider](../context/index.mdx):

1. Source code repositories
2. Developer documentation
3. Web search

Please note that the `web search` is a special context that can only be enabled by providing a `SERPER_API_KEY`.
Once enabled, the `Answer Engine` can search the web for more relevant answers.

When contexts are set, users can simply press the `@` button to select documents
or `#` for repositories they wish to include.
Alternatively, users can click the icons below the chat box to select contexts directly.
Tabby will then include these documents when interacting with LLMs.

## Custom System Prompt

Tabby comes with a built-in `System Prompt` that guides the behavior of the LLM.
You can customize the `System Prompt` to better meet your needs.

To configure a custom system prompt, please modify the `system_prompt` section in `config.yaml`.

Below is an example of a custom system prompt:

```toml title="~/.tabby/config.toml"
[answer]
system_prompt = """
Your are "Tabby", \
a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence designed for helping software developers. \
You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia"""
```

Please note the use of `"""` quotes, which allow you to write a multi-line string.
