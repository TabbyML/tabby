# Usage Analytics

Tabby provides comprehensive usage analytics to help teams track adoption and productivity. On the Reports page, you can monitor:
- **Code completion usage**: Track how team members are using Tabby's  code completions in their IDE extensions
- **Chat usage**: Track chat usage in both the IDE extensions and the [Answer Engine](../answer-engine/index.mdx)

You can use the Member Filter (see marker 1 in the screenshot below) to analyze:
- **Team-level**: Usage across all members
- **Individual-level**: Usage for specific users
