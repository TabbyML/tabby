# Deploy Tabby behind a reverse proxy

As an HTTP service, Tabby can be easily deployed behind a reverse proxy. The only thing you need to pay attention to is enabling the WebSocket connection, as it is used for the answer engine streaming.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="nginx" label="Nginx" default>

    Add the following to your Nginx configuration:

    ```
    location / {
        proxy_pass       http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
