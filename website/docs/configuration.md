## Usage Collection
Tabby collects usage stats by default. This data will only be used by the Tabby team to improve its services.

### What data is collected?
We collect non-sensitive data that helps us understand how Tabby is used. For now we collects `serve` command you used to start the server.

### How to disable it
To disable usage collection, set the `TABBY_DISABLE_USAGE_COLLECTION` environment variable by `export TABBY_DISABLE_USAGE_COLLECTION=1`.
