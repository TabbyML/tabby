* Developer experience
  - Expose API to Tabby's index.
  - Expose API to Q&A experience.
* Better Code Search
  - Allow semantic navigation of definition / declarations
* Enhanced organizational insight, easily identify and suggest team experts on specific questions


## Planning

### Q2 2025

*(Under construction)*

* 📜 Git commits history integration in Context Providers.
* ⚙️ Expose developer API to for ingest data into index.

### Q1 2025

* 🔐 LDAP Integration for SSO

* 🚀 Upgraded Answer Engine Experience
  - Detailed, step-by-step transparency: For example, procedures for searching through source code and extracting directory architecture.

* 📋 Facilitate the Discussion Threads into Knowledge Page.

### Q4 2024

* 🚀 Enhanced Answer Engine Experience
  - <s>Fine-grained step by step visibility: e.g., step to search source code, to extract directory structure.</s> (moved to Q1 2025)
  - Richer source visualization: e.g., GitHub issue status can be visualized.

* 🛠️ Improved Debugging / Admin Experience
  - Enhance background job visibility.
  - Enhance model backend status visibility.


### Q3 2024

* 👥 Team Collaboration:
  - Thread sharing.
  - Activity feeds.

* 🧩 Richer Integrations:
  - Integration with Slack.
  - Integration with Notion.

* 📈 Enhanced Robustness and Efficiency:
  - Improved robustness and efficiency of background jobs, such as source code indexing.

### Q2 2024

* 🎊 Supports embedding api for document context related use cases: https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/issues/790
* 📋 Client side context in IDE / Extensions, e.g recent viewed buffer, local changed files

### Q1 2024

* 🔐 SSO / OAuth support in Tabby EE: https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/issues/1039
* 🎭 Role management in Tabby EE.

### Q4 2023
* 🔧 Improve RAG by deeper integration with Treesitter using custom query. This will bring LSP-like understanding to Tabby's code index.
* 🎁 M1/M2 GPU support by utilizing llama.cpp/ggml's inference infrastructure. This will make Tabby much faster on Apple devices.
* 📘 Improve the documentation and tutorials for Tabby. This will make it easier for people to learn how to use Tabby.
* 💡 Explore more creative ways of interacting with Tabby. Tabby currently only supports generating text in code completion scenarios, but we plan to add support for other use cases, such as interactive chat in diff mode and Q&A with multiple virtual engineers.
