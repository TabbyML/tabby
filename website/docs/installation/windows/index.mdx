## 2. Download the release
* If you are using a CPU-only system, download the **tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc.exe file**.
* If you are using a GPU-enabled system, download the **tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc-cuda117.exe** file, In this example, we assume you are using CUDA 11.7.

**Tips:**
* Download the CUDA Toolkit from Nvidia: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
* Ensure that you have CUDA version 11 or higher installed.
* Check your local CUDA version by running the following command in a command prompt or PowerShell window:
```
nvcc --version
```

## 3. Running Tabby locally
Open a command prompt or PowerShell window in the directory where you downloaded the Tabby executable. Run the following command:
```
.\tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc-cuda117.exe serve --model StarCoder-1B --device cuda
```
You should see the following output if the command runs successfully:
