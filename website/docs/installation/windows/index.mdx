Running Tabby on Windows without WSL or Docker.

## 2. Download the release
* If you are using a CPU-only system, download the **tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc.exe file**.
* If you are using a GPU-enabled system, download the **tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc-cuda{VERSION}.exe** file, replacing {VERSION} with the appropriate CUDA version for your system.

**Tips:**
* Download the CUDA Toolkit from Nvidia: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
* Check your local CUDA version by running the following command in a command prompt or PowerShell window:
```
nvcc --version
```

## 3. Running Tabby Locally
Open a command prompt or PowerShell window in the directory where you downloaded the Tabby executable. Run the following command:
```
.\tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc-cuda{VERSION}.exe serve --device cuda
```
