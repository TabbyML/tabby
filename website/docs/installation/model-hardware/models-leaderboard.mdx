#  ðŸ“Š Models Leaderboard


We build Tabby as a transparent and flexible framework to enable AI coding assistant. 
To help users choose the desired LLM, we release [***Coding LLMs Leaderboard***](https://leaderboard.tabbyml.com) as a benchmark for Tabby's users to consider when making trade-offs between quality, licensing, and model size.


To learn more about how we built this leaderboard, please refer to our [blogpost](https://tabby.tabbyml.com/blog/2023/11/23/coding-llm-leaderboard).
