# Registering Accounts

After deploying Tabby, you will need to register an account to access the instance.

## Creating an Admin Account

The first registered account after deployment will be the admin account and will be granted the **owner** role.

## Entering Homepage

Once logged in, you will be redirected to the homepage. It contains basic information about your account. More importantly, you will find the credentials you need to connect your IDE/Editor extensions to Tabby.
