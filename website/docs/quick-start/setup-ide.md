# Connect IDE / Editor Extensions

Once you have registered your account, you can now connect your IDE / Editor extensions to Tabby. To do this, please follow the installation guide for [IDE / Editor Extensions](/docs/extensions/installation/vscode). In this example, we'll use VSCode.

In the extension settings, you need to fill in the Endpoint provided on the homepage. This Endpoint is essential for establishing a connection between your IDE / Editor and Tabby.

Once you have entered the Endpoint, you will receive a notification indicating that an access token is required. This access token is to authenticate you as a user of Tabby. Click on the **Set Credentials** button and enter the token acquired from the homepage.
