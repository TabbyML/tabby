# Linux
Running Tabby on Linux using Tabby's standalone executable distribution.

## Find the Linux release
* Go to the Tabby release page: https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/releases
* Click on the **Assets** dropdown for a specific release to find the manylinux zip files.

</div>

## Download the release
* If you are using a CPU-only system, download the **tabby_x86_64-manylinux2014.zip**.
* If you are using a GPU-enabled system, download the **tabby_x86_64-manylinux2014-cuda117.zip**, In this example, we assume you are using CUDA 11.7.
* If you want to use a non-nvidia GPU, download the **tabby_x86_64-manylinux2014-vulkan.zip**. See https://tabby.tabbyml.com/blog/2024/05/01/vulkan-support/ for more info.

**Tips:**
* For the CUDA versions, you will need the nvidia-cuda-toolkit installed for your distribution.
  * In ubuntu, this would be `sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`.
  * The CUDA Toolkit is available directly from Nvidia: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
  * Ensure that you have CUDA version 11 or higher installed.
  * Check your local CUDA version by running the following command in a terminal: `nvcc --version`
* For the Vulkan version you'll need the vulkan library. In ubuntu, this would be `sudo apt install libvulkan1`.

## Katana (optional but recommended)

Tabby utilizes [Katana](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana) as a crawling backend for the `developer docs` context provider.
To import and analyze `developer docs` when llms.txt is unavailable at the specified link, Katana is required.
Please be aware that the minimum Katana version required is `1.1.2`.

The simplest way to install Katana is to download a prebuilt binary from the official releases:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/releases/download/v1.1.2/katana_1.1.2_linux_amd64.zip -o katana.zip
unzip katana.zip katana
sudo mv katana /usr/bin/
rm katana.zip
```
This works well for most Linux environments. If you're using a different environment, please refer to the 
[official installation instructions](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana#installation).


## Find the Linux executable file
* Unzip the file you downloaded. The `tabby` executable will be in a subdirectory of dist.
* Change to this subdirectory or relocate `tabby` to a folder of your choice.
* Make it executable: `chmod +x tabby llama-server`

Run the following command:
```
# For CPU-only environments
./tabby serve --model StarCoder-1B --chat-model Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct

# For GPU-enabled environments (where DEVICE is cuda or vulkan)
./tabby serve --model StarCoder-1B --chat-model Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct --device $DEVICE
```
You can choose different models, as shown in [the model registry](https://tabby.tabbyml.com/docs/models/)

You should see a success message similar to the one in the screenshot below. After that, you can visit http://localhost:8080 to access your Tabby instance.
