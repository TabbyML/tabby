# Windows
Running Tabby on Windows using Tabby's exe distribution.

## Find the Windows release
* Go to the Tabby release page: https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/releases
* Click on the **Assets** dropdown for a specific release to find the Windows zip files.

</div>

## Download the release
* If you are using a CPU-only system, download the **tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc.zip**.
* If you are using a GPU-enabled system, download the **tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc-cuda117.zip**, In this example, we assume you are using CUDA 11.7.

**Tips:**
* Download the CUDA Toolkit from Nvidia: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
* Ensure that you have CUDA version 11 or higher installed.
* Check your local CUDA version by running the following command in a command prompt or PowerShell window:
```
nvcc --version
```

## Find the Windows executable file
* Unzip the file `tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc-cuda117.zip`.
* Navigate to the extracted folder named `tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc-cuda117`.
* Inside this folder, go to `dist` -> `tabby_x86_64-windows-msvc-cuda117`.
* In this directory, you'll find an executable file named `tabby.exe`.

## Running Tabby
Open a command prompt or PowerShell window, as administrator, in the directory where the `tabby.exe` is located (from the previous step).

Run the following command:
```
# For CPU-only environments
.\tabby.exe serve --model StarCoder-1B --chat-model Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct

# For CUDA-enabled environments
.\tabby.exe serve --model StarCoder-1B --chat-model Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct --device cuda
```

You should see a success message similar to the one in the screenshot below. After that, you can visit http://localhost:8080 to access your Tabby instance.
