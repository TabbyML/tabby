# Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

Run Tabby on Windows using **Ubuntu via WSL2** for a native Linux experience with full GPU support and advanced developer control.

## 1. Install WSL2 and Ubuntu

You can install either **Ubuntu 22.04** or **Ubuntu 24.04** — both work with Tabby.

> **Which version should I choose?**
>
> - Ubuntu **22.04** is the default and used in Tabby’s Docker image  
> - Ubuntu **24.04** is newer and confirmed to work well with this guide  
>
> To install WSL2: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

Install your preferred Ubuntu version:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu        # for Ubuntu 22.04
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04  # for Ubuntu 24.04
```
After installation, reboot if required, then launch Ubuntu and set up your UNIX user.

## 2. Follow the Linux installation guide

Once inside your Ubuntu WSL terminal, just follow the [Linux instructions](./linux). No extra steps
needed — Tabby will run locally and privately, with GPU passthrough handled by WSL2 and Windows.

## 3. Access Tabby from Windows

Once Tabby is running in Ubuntu, it will usually be available at:  

`http://localhost:8080` (or your chosen port)
