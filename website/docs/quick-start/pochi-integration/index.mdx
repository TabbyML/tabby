# Pochi Integration

After configuring the [Endpoint API](../../administration/endpoint),
you can use it to serve as [Pochi](https://github.com/TabbyML/pochi) models and experience the agentic coding assistant.

We have already integrated Tabby endpoints API as one of the pochi model providers,
So all you need to do is to login to Tabby in Pochi through the pochi CLI.

1. Install [Pochi CLI](https://docs.getpochi.com/cli/) if you haven't done so.
2. Login to Tabby in Pochi through the pochi CLI, run `pochi auth login` and select tabby.

   ```console
   root@tabby-server:~# pochi auth login
   ? Select a vendor to authenticate with:
   ❯ tabby - Not logged in
     pochi - Not logged in
     gemini-cli - Not logged in
     codex - Not logged in
     github-copilot - Not logged in
     qwen-code - Not logged in

   Current selection: Not logged in
   Use arrow keys to navigate, enter to select
   ```

3. Input your Tabby Server URL(default: http://localhost:8080, press enter to use default) and TOKEN.

   ```console
   root@tabby-server:~# pochi auth login
   ✔ Select a vendor to authenticate with: tabby - Not logged in
   Enter Tabby Server URL (default: http://localhost:8080):
   Enter Tabby Token: TABBY_TOKEN
   Logged in as Admin (admin@example.com)
   ```

4. The tabby models would be listed in the model list.
