# function "_component_func", with an underscore prefix, because we don't want
# to expose it directly to users. Instead, we will create a custom wrapper
# function, below, that will serve as our component's public API.

# It's worth noting that this call to `declare_component` is the
# *only thing* you need to do to create the binding between Streamlit and
# your component frontend. Everything else we do in this file is simply a
# best practice.

# Create a wrapper function for the component. This is an optional
# best practice - we could simply expose the component function returned by
# `declare_component` and call it done. The wrapper allows us to customize
# our component's API: we can pre-process its input args, post-process its
# output value, and add a docstring for users.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the thing we're saying hello to. The component will display
        the text "Hello, {name}!"
    key: str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The number of times the component's "Click Me" button has been clicked.
        (This is the value passed to `Streamlit.setComponentValue` on the
        frontend.)

    """
    # Call through to our private component function. Arguments we pass here
    # will be sent to the frontend, where they'll be available in an "args"
    # dictionary.
    #
    # "default" is a special argument that specifies the initial return
    # value of the component before the user has interacted with it.
    component_value = _component_func(name=name, key=key, default=0)

# Add some test code to play with the component while it's in development.
