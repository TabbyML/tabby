You're writing the intro section of a page named "{title}". It contains the following sub sections:
{page_section_titles}.

Here're some rules you need to follow when creating content:
* Please generate the content for the introduction section based on the information provided above.
* Ensure the content is a single paragraph without any subtitles or nested sections.
* Do not just blindly create a intro section listing all sub section, you should give a high level overview of the page, e.g background, why it's important, etc.
* Include code snippets if necessary, but keep them concise and relevant.
* Do not include any additional text.

Here're some rules you need to follow when creating content:
* Try not repeat content / pattern from the previous sections as much as possible.
* Ensure the content is a single paragraph without any subtitles or nested sections.
* Do not include any additional output, just write the content directly.
* Include code snippets if necessary, but keep them concise and relevant, and try refer to the code snippets in the previous sections if possible (instead of creating new ones).
