## v0.25.2 (2025-02-28)

### Notice

* This is a patch release, please also check [the historical release note](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/releases/tag/v0.25.1) for 0.25.1.

### Fixed and Improvements

* Alter the LDAP login mechanism to query users across the Organizational Unit subtree rather than a single level. An LDAP directory is structured hierarchically as a tree of nodes. This modification empowers all users beneath the LDAP Organizational Unit (OU) subtree to authenticate, rather than restricting access to users within a specific OU.
