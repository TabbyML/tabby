* The `--webserver` flag is now enabled by default in `tabby serve`. To turn off the webserver and only use OSS features, use the `--no-webserver` flag.
* The `/v1beta/chat/completions` endpoint has been moved to `/v1/chat/completions`, while the old endpoint is still available for backward compatibility.

### Features
* Upgraded [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to version [b2715](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b2715).
* Added support for integrating repositories from GitHub and GitLab using personal access tokens.
* Introduced a new **Activities** page to view user activities.

* The `/v1beta/chat/completions` API endpoint is now compatible with OpenAI's chat completion API.
* Models from our official registry can now be referred to without the TabbyML prefix. Therefore, for the model TabbyML/CodeLlama-7B, you can simply refer to it as CodeLlama-7B everywhere.

## v0.7.0 (12/15/2023)

### Features

* Tabby now includes built-in user management and secure access, ensuring that it is only accessible to your team.
* The `--webserver` flag is a new addition to `tabby serve` that enables secure access to the tabby server. When this flag is on, IDE extensions will need to provide an authorization token to access the instance.
  - Some functionalities that are bound to the webserver (e.g. playground) will also require the `--webserver` flag.

* Due to indexing format changes, the `~/.tabby/index` needs to be manually removed before any further runs of `tabby scheduler`.
* `TABBY_REGISTRY` is replaced with `TABBY_DOWNLOAD_HOST` for the github based registry implementation.

### Features

* Improved dashboard UI.

## v0.2.2 (10/09/2023)
### Fixes and improvements

* Fix a critical issue that might cause request dead locking in ctranslate2 backend (when loading is heavy)

## v0.2.1 (10/03/2023)
### Features
#### Chat Model & Web Interface

We have introduced a new argument, `--chat-model`, which allows you to specify the model for the chat playground located at http://localhost:8080/playground

To utilize this feature, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
tabby serve --device metal --model TabbyML/StarCoder-1B --chat-model TabbyML/Mistral-7B
```

#### ModelScope Model Registry

Mainland Chinese users have been facing challenges accessing Hugging Face due to various reasons. The Tabby team is actively working to address this issue by mirroring models to a hosting provider in mainland China called modelscope.cn.

```bash
## Download from the Modelscope registry
TABBY_REGISTRY=modelscope tabby download --model TabbyML/WizardCoder-1B
```

### Fixes and improvements

* Implemented more accurate UTF-8 incremental decoding in the [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/pull/491).
* Fixed the stop words implementation by utilizing RegexSet to isolate the stop word group.
* Improved model downloading logic; now Tabby will attempt to fetch the latest model version if there's a remote change, and the local cache key becomes stale.
* set default num_replicas_per_device for ctranslate2 backend to increase parallelism.
