## v0.17.0 (2024-09-10)

### Notice

* We've reworked the `Web` (a beta feature) context provider into the `Developer Docs` context provider. Previously added context in the `Web` tab has been cleared and needs to be manually migrated to `Developer Docs`.

### Features

* Extensive rework has been done in the answer engine search box.
  - Developer Docs / Web search is now triggered by `@`.
  - Repository Context is now selected using `#`.

* Supports OCaml
