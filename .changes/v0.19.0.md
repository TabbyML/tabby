## v0.19.0 (2024-10-21)

### Features

* Added recently opened files to code completion requests ([#2664](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/issues/2664)).
* For Answer Engine, when the file content is reasonably short (e.g., less than 200 lines of code), include the entire file content directly instead of only the chunk ([#3096](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/issues/3096)).
* Allow editing the current prompt in the chat side panel to refine prompt writing.
* Automatically apply code blocks from the chat side panel without needing to select the range in the editor ([#3028](https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby/issues/3028)).
* Allowed adding additional languages through the `config.toml` file.
* Allowed customizing the `system_prompt` for Answer Engine.

### Fixes and Improvements

* Redesigned homepage to make team activities (e.g., threads discussed in Answer Engine) discoverable.
* Supported downloading models with multiple partitions (e.g., Qwen-2.5 series).
