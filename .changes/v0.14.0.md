## v0.14.0 (2024-07-23)

### Features
* Code search functionality is now available in the `Code Browser` tab. Users can search for code using regex patterns and filter by language, repository, and branch.
* Initial experimental support for natural language to codebase conversation in `Answer Engine`.

### Fixed and Improvements

* Incremental issues / PRs indexing by checking `updated_at`.
* Canonicalize `git_url` before performing a relevant code search. Previously, for git_urls with credentials, the canonicalized git_url was used in the index, but the query still used the raw git_url.
* bump llama.cpp to b3370 - which fixes Qwen2 model series inference
