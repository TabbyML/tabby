## v0.16.1 (2024-08-27)

### Notice
* Starting from this version, we are utilizing websockets for features that require streaming (e.g., Answer Engine and Chat Side Panel). If you are deploying tabby behind a reverse proxy, you may need to configure the proxy to support websockets.

### Features

* Discussion threads in the Answer Engine are now persisted, allowing users to share threads with others.

### Fixed and Improvements

* Fixed an issue where the llama-server subprocess was not being reused when reusing a model for Chat / Completion together (e.g., Codestral-22B) with the local model backend.
* Updated llama.cpp to version b3571 to support the jina series embedding models.
