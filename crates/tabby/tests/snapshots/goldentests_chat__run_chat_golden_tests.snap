" You can convert a list of strings to numbers in Python using the built-in `list()` function. Here's an example:\n```python\nstrings = ['1', '2', '3']\nnumbers = list(map(int, strings))\nprint(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3]\n```\nIn this example, we first define a list `strings` containing three string values. We then use the `map()` function to apply the `int()` function (which converts a string to an integer) to each element of the `strings` list, and the resulting list of integers is stored in the variable `numbers`. Finally, we print the `numbers` list to verify that the conversion was successful."
