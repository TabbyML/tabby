" To parse an email address with regex, you can use the following pattern:\n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\nThis pattern matches email addresses in the following format:\n\n* `^`: start of the string\n* `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: matches one or more characters that are either letters, numbers, periods, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, or hyphens\n* `@`: matches the \"@\" symbol\n* `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+`: matches one or more characters that are either letters, numbers, periods, or hyphens\n* `\\.`: matches the \".\" symbol\n* `[a-zA-Z]{2,}`: matches two or more characters that are letters\n* `$`: end of the string\n\nYou can use this pattern in a programming language that supports regex, such as Python, JavaScript, or Java, to extract the email address from a string. For example, in Python, you can use the `re` module to find all email addresses in a string:\n```\nimport re\n\nstring = \"Please send your feedback to john.doe@example.com or jane_doe@example.co.uk.\"\n\npattern = r\"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\"\n\nemails = re.findall(pattern, string)\n\nprint(emails)  # Output: ['john.doe@example.com', 'jane_doe@example.co.uk']\n```"
