# Code Completion

## Basic Usage

Tabby will show inline suggestions when you stop typing, and you can accept suggestions by just pressing the `Tab` key.

## Cycling Through Choices

When multiple choices are available, you can cycle through them by pressing `Alt + [` and `Alt + ]`.

## Keybindings

You can select a keybinding profile in the [settings](command:tabby.openSettings), or customize your own [keybindings](command:tabby.openKeybindings).
