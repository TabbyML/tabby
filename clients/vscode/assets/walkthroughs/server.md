# Tabby Server

Choose your preferred way to host your Tabby server, either through Tabby Cloud or by self-hosting.

## Tabby Cloud

You can get a Tabby Cloud account [here](https://app.tabbyml.com). Once you create or join a workspace, you will receive a URL for your Tabby server endpoint.  
**Note**: Tabby Cloud is currently in beta. Join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/tabbycommunity/shared_invite/zt-1xeiddizp-bciR2RtFTaJ37RBxr8VxpA) and ask in Tabby Cloud channel to get a beta invite.
