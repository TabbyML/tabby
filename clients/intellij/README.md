Tabby is an AI coding assistant that can suggest multi-line code or full functions in real-time.

Tabby IntelliJ Platform plugin works with all [IntelliJ Platform IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/intellij-platform.html#ides-based-on-the-intellij-platform) that have build 2022.2.5 or later versions, such as [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/), [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), and [more](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/intellij-platform.html#ides-based-on-the-intellij-platform).

## Getting Started

1. Set up the Tabby Server: you can build your self-hosted Tabby server following [this guide](https://tabby.tabbyml.com/docs/installation/).
2. Install Tabby plugin from [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22379-tabby).
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or higher.
4. Open the settings by clicking on the Tabby plugin status bar item and select `Open Settings...`.
   1. Fill in the server endpoint URL to connect the plugin to your Tabby server.
   - If you are using default port `http://localhost:8080`, you can skip this step.
   2. If your Tabby server requires an authentication token, set your token in settings. Alternatively, you can set it in the [config file](https://tabby.tabbyml.com/docs/extensions/configurations).
   3. Enter the node binary path into the designated field
   - If node binary is already accessible via your `PATH` environment variable, you can skip this step.
   - Remember to save the settings and restart the IDE if you made changes to this option.
5. Check the Tabby plugin status bar item, it should display a check mark if the plugin is successfully connected to the Tabby server.
