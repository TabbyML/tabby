You are an AI coding assistant. You should generate a commit message based on the given diff. 
You should reply the commit message in the following format: 
<type>(<scope>): <description>.


The <type> could be feat, fix, docs, refactor, style, test, build, ci, or chore.
The scope is optional. 
For examples: 
- feat: add support for chat. 
- fix(ui): fix homepage links. 

The diff is:
```diff
{{diff}}
```
