# Tabby-Threads

**Tabby-Threads** is an internally customized version of [`@quilted/threads`](https://github.com/lemonmade/quilt/tree/%40quilted/threads%402.2.0/packages/threads) 2.2.0, specifically designed for the Tabby project. This library adapts and extends the functionality of `@quilted/threads` to better meet the unique requirements of the project.

## Purpose

- **Internal Use Only**: This library is strictly for use within the Tabby project and is not intended for external distribution or public usage.
- **Custom Enhancements**: Includes modifications and optimizations tailored for Tabbyâ€™s specific use cases.
- **No External Support**: As an internal tool, `tabby-threads` does not include usage documentation or external support.

## Foundation

Tabby-Threads builds upon `@quilted/threads` 2.2.0, inheriting its core features:

- Cross-thread communication via multiple mechanisms like `Worker`, `MessagePort`, and `BroadcastChannel`.
- Robust TypeScript support with thread-safe APIs.

For further details on the underlying framework, refer to the official [`@quilted/threads`](https://github.com/lemonmade/quilt/tree/main/packages/threads) documentation.
